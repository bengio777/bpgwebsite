  Not too long ago, about six months, I found myself dissatisfied with my
  professional life. Over the past several years I've been working in the
  music industry in various capacities performing manual labor or other menial
  tasks that were neither intellectually fulfilling or commanding decent pay.
  I sat down and I wrote about where I would like to find myself in 1, 5,
  or even 10 years from now. After I imagined what my future would look like
  I wrote down possible ways I could get there. I took inventory of my
  strengths, my weaknesses, and what was important to me. Then I thought
  about problems I see in the world around me and how I could make a place
  for myself creating improvements. I came up with a number of business ideas
  and then over the coming weeks and months I began a process of researching
  then writing out and planning every detail of what it would take to realize
  my vision from raising capital, hiring employees, building relationships,
  marketing, even down to the tiny details of how I want the names of my
  companies to sound phonetically pleasing or what color schemas are suitable
  to the industry. However, it occurred to me, in this day and age, what is
  a man with ideas but without capital? Furthermore, how do you leverage
  your intellectual property efficiently and attract other like minded and
  inspired people to your cause? Perhaps just being an "idea man" isn't enough?

  I realized a number of things are important to me: creativity, fun,
  adventure, and leaving a positive impact. There are millions of people
  like me around the world who are striving for to make their mark,
  live exciting lives, and all of them with brilliant ideas about the way
  things should be. I think code is actually a wonderful metaphor for many
  challenges we approach to life because despite the fact that in often times
  the problem solving process may be utterly tortuous there are many
  different solutions to the problems and challenges we encounter.

 <p class="pg">
  Often times I have my head in the clouds and I think that learning code
  is personally a great challenge for grounding my thoughts in meticulous
  and detail oriented work.

  In an ideal world, upon graduation from Galvanize I would like to secure
  a job with a technological firm and there over several years gain
  both experience as well as financial stability while working on projects
  to build start-ups with friends. At some point I would also like to take
  advantage of codings ability to enable mobile work and make anywhere in the
  world with an internet connection my office. Most of all, I think what is
  exciting about tech is the ultimate goal is innovation so that leaves my
  future open to working in a wide array of potential fields!
